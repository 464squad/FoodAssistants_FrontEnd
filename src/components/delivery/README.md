This is the documentation for our delivery service!

In terms of how the deliveries should be formatted, it would most likely be with a table that represents where the deliveries are being made such as with locations and the items being delivered. The items can range from grocerie items to fast food. There may also be columns that contain info of the user requesting the food items (that being their name, phone number, as well as order number), the items in the order, the person delivering the order (as well as his phone number) to contact them, and where the order is going to be delivered.

There may also need to be a locator (a good example being in amazon) where the service shows how many stops the person taking the food is before going to your location. One issue that would be something to worry about would be how many people are making deliveries at once and what to do if a delivery wouldn't be able to go through successfully where a refund would need to be issued. Delivery drivers would also need their own unique ID to differentiate them by as well as showing where they're at.
