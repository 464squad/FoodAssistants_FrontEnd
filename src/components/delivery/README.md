This is the documentation for our delivery service!

In terms of how the deliveries should be formatted, it would most likely be with a table that represents where the deliveries are being made such as with locations and the items being delivered. The items can range from grocerie items to fast food. There may also be columns that contain info of the user requesting the food items (that being their name, phone number, as well as order number), the items in the order, the person delivering the order (as well as his phone number) to contact them, and where the order is going to be delivered.
